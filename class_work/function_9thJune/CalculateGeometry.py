# Program for The operations of two-dimensional figures
"""
Problem Statement:
Create a program which provides a menu to the user to select a two-dimensional figure (rectangle, square, circle).
After selecting the figure user is again asked to provide the input of corresponding data for for the figure .
After input og corresponding data again provide a menu to the user to select the operation (area, perimeter) to be performed on the figure.
and as per the user selection perform the operation and display the result to the user.
This task is repeated again and again until the user selects the option to exit from that figure and back to previous menu to select another figure or exit from the program.
